# Kintsugi AI — Demo Scenarios

Use these scenarios for a live project demonstration.

## Scenario 1: "The Overwhelmed High Performer" (Recommended for Demo)

**Context:**
> I am a team lead. One of my previously strong team members, Ravi, has started missing deadlines and using office time for personal projects. My client has lost trust in our delivery, and my manager has been having altercations with me about it. I need to address this directly but I also want to understand what's going on.

**Person:** Ravi

**Emotion:** Frustrated

**Suggested opening lines to try:**
1. "Ravi, I wanted to talk about the project timelines. The client has raised concerns and I need to understand what's happening."
2. "Hey Ravi, I'm going to be honest — delivery has slipped and the pressure is landing on me. Can we talk about what's going on?"
3. "Ravi, I care about your work here. But I need us to figure this out together before it gets worse."

**What to watch for in the Mirror:**
- The AI should identify high-pressure language like "deadlines slipping" or "client concerns"
- The empathy gap should reflect that Ravi may be struggling privately
- The repair suggestion should model curiosity over blame

## Scenario 2: "The Difficult Client Call"

**Context:**
> I'm a project manager and my biggest client, Sarah, is angry about repeated delays. She's threatening to cancel the contract. I need to have a call with her today to address her concerns, take accountability, and present a recovery plan — without being defensive.

**Person:** Sarah

**Emotion:** Anxious

**Suggested opening lines:**
1. "Sarah, I appreciate you making time for this call. I know the delays have been frustrating and I want to address that directly."
2. "Before we get into the recovery plan, I want to acknowledge that we haven't met your expectations — and I take full responsibility for that."

## Scenario 3: "Setting Boundaries with a Manager"

**Context:**
> My manager keeps assigning me work outside my role at 7pm on Fridays. I've been doing it to be a team player, but I'm burning out. I need to have an honest conversation about workload boundaries without damaging our relationship or seeming uncommitted.

**Person:** My Manager

**Emotion:** Overwhelmed

**Suggested opening lines:**
1. "I wanted to talk about something that's been on my mind. I want to do great work here, and I think we need to discuss how I can do that sustainably."
2. "I appreciate that you trust me with extra work. I want to be honest about where I'm at so I can keep delivering at the level you expect."

## Tips for Presenters

- **Use voice input** 🎤 for at least one message — it demonstrates the STT feature
- **Leave TTS on** 🔊 for the first AI response — hearing the response adds impact
- **Don't rush** — let the AI response load naturally, it shows the real-time feel
- **If practice mode appears** — explain the 3-tier fallback system (it's a feature, not a bug)
- **Scenario 1 is the strongest** for demonstrating all features
